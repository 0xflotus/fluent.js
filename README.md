Fluent.js is a JavaScript implementation of Project Fluent, a localization
framework designed to unleash the entire expressive power of natural language
translations.

Project Fluent keeps simple things simple and makes complex things possible.
The syntax used for describing translations is easy to read and understand.  At
the same time it allows, when necessary, to represent complex concepts from
natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and others.


Installation
------------

Fluent.js can be used both on the client-side and the server-side.  Install the
`fluent` package from the npm registry:

    npm install fluent

Fluent.js also works as a standalone script (as the `Fluent` global) and with
`RequireJS`.


How to use Fluent.js
--------------------

When you import the `fluent` module it will add the `Intl.MessageContext`
constructor to the global `Intl` object, together with a few other polyfills.
You can consult the complete list of the polyfills in [src/intl/polyfill.js]. 

`Intl.MessageContext` provides the core functionality of formatting
translations from FTL files.

[src/intl/polyfill.js]: https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/blob/master/src/intl/polyfill.js

```javascript
require('fluent');

const ctx = new Intl.MessageContext('en-US');

const errors = ctx.addMessages(`
brand-name = Foo 3000
welcome    = Welcome, { $name }, to { brand-name }!
`);

if (errors.length) {
  // syntax errors are per-message and don't break the whole resource
}

const welcome = ctx.messages.get('welcome');

ctx.format(welcome, { name: 'Anna' });
// â†’ 'Welcome, Anna, to Foo 3000!'
```

You can access other API methods by requiring the `fluent` module.  The
currently exposed functions can be found in [src/index.js][].  Keep in mind
that `fluent` is in its 0.x days and that the exposed API may change.

Learn the FTL syntax
--------------------

FTL is a localization file format used for describing translation resources.
FTL stands for _Fluent Translation List_.

FTL is designed to be simple to read, but at the same time allows to represent
complex concepts from natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations,
and others.

    hello-user = Hello, { $username }!

[Read the Fluent Syntax Guide][] in order to learn more about the syntax.  If
you're a tool author you may be interested in the formal [EBNF grammar][].
