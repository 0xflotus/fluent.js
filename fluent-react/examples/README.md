# fluent-react examples

These tiny React apps demonstrate how `fluent-react` can integrate with React.

    cd hello-world
    npm install
    npm start

All examples link to the local ES2015+ `fluent` modules as dependencies. They
are resolved via the `module` field of their `package.json` files and thus do
not require to be built nor transpiled beforehand.
